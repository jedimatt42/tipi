# Setting up...

## If using the SD-Card image the following has already been performed.

SD Card image is available for download: 

[www.jedimatt42.com](https://www.jedimatt42.com/downloads.html)

Go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/jedimatt42/tipi/wiki) for end user installation.

# Only follow these instructions if you are setting up an SD Card from scratch.

Assumes base image is Raspbian Lite

Use raspi-config to install locales and set default, en_US_utf8.
Note: installing all locales takes forever, and slows future updates.
install en-US-UTF8, en-GB-UTF8, de-DE-UTF8, and en-CA-UTF8

Use raspi-config to enable ssh, and grow the root filesystem.
reboot.

## Replace log and tmp folders with tmpfs to prolong SD card life

Add the following to /etc/fstab:

```
tmpfs    /tmp    tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=100m    0 0
tmpfs    /var/tmp    tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=30m    0 0
tmpfs    /var/log    tmpfs    defaults,noatime,nosuid,mode=0755,size=100m    0 0
```

Cleanup files under those subdirectories, and mount the tmpfs filesystems.

```
sudo rm -r /tmp/*
sudo rm -r /var/tmp/*
sudo rm -r /var/log/*
sudo mount /tmp
sudo mount /var/tmp
sudo mount /var/log
```

## Create the tipi service user

Login to the Raspberry PI as user 'pi'. 
Create a service user 'tipi' with the following commands:

```
sudo useradd --create-home --system --user-group tipi
sudo adduser tipi gpio
sudo adduser tipi input
sudo adduser tipi sudo
sudo passwd tipi
```

## Install Software

Make sure git is installed (after setting up tmpfs folders, update will be required)

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

## Install services

Setup the services, by becoming the 'tipi' user, cloning the git repository 
within the 'tipi' user home directory, and running the setup.sh script.

Become the tipi user

```
sudo su tipi
```

While executing the following, when prompted for a 'sudo' password, it 
is for the 'tipi' user.

```
cd /home/tipi
git clone https://github.com/jedimatt42/tipi.git tipi
cd /home/tipi/tipi
git checkout buster_release
git submodule update --init
./setup.sh
cd setup
sudo ./post-upgrade.sh
```

## Other items to setup

Disable apache2 which is misconfigured and not-used

```
sudo apt systemctl disable apache2.service
```

* (for distributing an image, I don't do this) change the password for user pi
* change the hostname (raspi-config)
* install samba share for /home/tipi/tipi_disk
* add telnetd for localhost access

```
sudo apt install telnetd
```

   edit /etc/hosts.allow: 

```
in.telnetd: localhost
```

   edit /etc/hosts.deny: 

```
in.telnetd: ALL
```


Changing hostname: /etc/hostname & /etc/hosts

Recommended Samba configuration for /etc/samba/smb.conf:

```
[TIPI]
comment=TI-99/4A Files
path=/home/tipi/tipi_disk
public=no
browseable=Yes
writeable=Yes
only guest=no
guest ok=Yes
create mask=0644
directory mask=0755
force user=tipi
```

## Test WIFI Connectivity

Make sure wifi was working before archiving the image. 

### Capture SD Card Image

On a linux system dump the sdcard to an image. Then mount the image and clear unused blocks before zipping.

run dmesg to see what device sd card mounted as... presuming it was /dev/sdb:

```
sudo dd status=progress if=/dev/sdb of=sdimage.img bs=4M
sudo kpartx -a sdimage.img
```

You should be able to now mount the rootfs, or /dev/mapper/loop??p2.  On ubuntu like desktops the volume names will show up in the UI for removable media... 

Edit and Remove personal settings found in
- home/tipi/tipi.config
- etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Then clear the space:

```
cd /media/`whoami`/rootfs
sudo dd status=progress if=/dev/zero of=zeroes bs=4M
sudo sync
sudo rm zeroes
cd
umount /media/`whoami`/rootfs
```

Now zip it up!
