# Contributing to the source

Use the normal github fork and merge request method.

Make sure the merge request contains enough information for me to keep the tipi.wiki up to date and accurate. Or fork the wiki and submit an issue with the changes and branch details so I can merge them in. 

## Contraints on what might not be accepted:

TIPI is a peripheral device for a TI-99/4A. I'm not interested in adding general purpose compute features. Features should be usable and driven from the 4A, without requiring playing in the unix shell on the Raspberry PI. 

## I'm happy to help

This is an on going project. I don't expect it to ever be 'complete'. So I'm glad to help incorporate ideas and code into the framework that I've setup.
