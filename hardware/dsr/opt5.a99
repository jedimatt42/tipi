* Modified XB scratchpad loader code from harmlesslion.com 
* - http://www.harmlesslion.com/cgi-bin/onesoft.cgi?59
*
* I purged all the DSR related stuff to rewrite as optimized code
* when stuck in the TIPI DSR. No need for DSR lookup and search.

VDPADR	EQU	>1380 		address to load the file(s) in vdp ram (EA uses >1380)
VDPPAB	EQU	VDPADR-740		address of the first pab in vdp ram (10 PABs at 74 bytes each)

WS	EQU	>8300
