# TIPI

(Pronounced tip-ee)

Turn a Raspberry PI and some glue hardware into a TI Disk Drive and Network interface. 

Keep it open for further device extension.

## Branching

End users must be on the 'release' branch. 
'master' branch is full of stuff that doesn't work, won't upgrade correctly, and certainly won't downgrade.
'master' branch is expert mode only.
